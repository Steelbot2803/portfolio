Iâ€™m a Junior Mechanical Engineer passionate about turning complex mechanical challenges into efficient, manufacturable solutions. With hands-on experience in design, FEA, CNC process optimization, and shop floor management, I bring a strong blend of analytical thinking and practical execution. At IPA Pvt. Ltd., I led initiatives that tripled CNC output, improved calibration accuracy by 15%, and streamlined machine shop workflows using data dashboards and skill audits.

My background includes optimizing wind turbine blade profiles (boosting efficiency by 35%) and designing cost-effective systems like a 40%-cheaper oxygen concentrator and a modular heat sink with 20% better thermal performance. I hold an MS in Mechanical Engineering from UT Dallas and a BTech from VIT Vellore, and Iâ€™m proficient in SolidWorks, Fusion 360, ANSYS, and Python. My work consistently focuses on innovation, cost reduction, and cross-functional collaboration.
