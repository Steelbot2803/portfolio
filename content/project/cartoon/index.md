Carried out aerodynamic and structural optimization of a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) rotor blade to enhance energy capture efficiency. Modeled baseline rotor geometries using SolidWorks and analyzed blade performance using Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) implemented in MATLAB. Validated aerodynamic behavior via CFD simulations in ANSYS Fluent to visualize flow patterns, pressure zones, and lift distribution. Conducted a parametric study on blade pitch angle, chord distribution, and tip speed ratio to determine the optimal configuration for maximum power coefficient (Cp). The optimized blade design demonstrated improved aerodynamic performance and better load distribution.
