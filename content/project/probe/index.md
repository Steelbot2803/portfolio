As part of a research-driven simulation project, I studied the thermal radiation interaction properties of shielding materials used in space probes operating in extreme near-sun and deep-space conditions.

The project focused on analyzing how materials respond to the harsh radiation environment of space, specifically examining absorptivity (how much solar radiation is absorbed) and emissivity (how efficiently that absorbed energy is re-radiated as heat). Striking the right balance between these two properties is criticalâ€”materials must shield sensitive electronics from harmful radiation while also preventing thermal buildup that can damage onboard systems.

Through a combination of literature analysis, material testing data, and simulation-based evaluation, I assessed candidate materials for their suitability in long-duration solar probe missions. The findings contribute to a better understanding of passive thermal management in spacecraft, supporting the development of next-generation probes capable of surviving extended exposure to solar radiation, cosmic rays, and high-energy particles.

This project deepened my interest in space systems engineering, thermal dynamics, and materials science at the intersection of mechanical design and aerospace application.
