As part of a research project under Dr. Valerio Giacomo Iungo, I conducted the aerodynamic optimization of a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) rotor blade to improve power extraction efficiency under controlled wind conditions.

The entire simulation and optimization workflow was carried out in QBlade, where I applied Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT), along with Schmitz and Betz analytical functions, to iteratively refine blade geometry. The goal was to design a near-optimal rotor profile that performs efficiently at a Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) of 7.5 and a wind speed of 7 m/s.

I conducted detailed parametric studies varying blade twist, chord distribution, and airfoil selection to maximize the power coefficient (Cp) while ensuring aerodynamic stability across the blade span.

I conducted detailed parametric studies varying blade twist, chord distribution, and airfoil selection to maximize the power coefficient (Cp) while ensuring aerodynamic stability across the blade span.

This project deepened my understanding of wind turbine aerodynamics, low-speed rotor efficiency, and the application of theoretical and simulation-based methods for performance-driven blade design in renewable energy systems.
