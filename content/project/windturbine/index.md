As part of a research project under Dr. Valerio Giacomo Iungo, I worked on the aerodynamic and structural optimization of a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) rotor blade to improve overall energy capture efficiency.

The design and simulation process was carried out primarily in QBlade, where I analyzed rotor performance using Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) and performed parametric studies on blade geometryâ€”including pitch angle, chord distribution, and tip speed ratio.

Once optimal configurations were identified, I modeled the final rotor geometry in Fusion 360, focusing on manufacturability, blade taper, and structural consistency.

To validate aerodynamic behavior and verify performance predictions, I used ANSYS Fluent for CFD simulations, examining flow characteristics, pressure distribution, and lift forces across the blade span.

This project gave me hands-on experience with renewable energy system design, simulation-based optimization, and cross-platform workflows across CAD and CFD environments.
