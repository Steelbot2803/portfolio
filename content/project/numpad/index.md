As a personal challenge and passion project, I designed a fully custom mechanical numpad that combines function, form, and fun. This wasn’t built for commercial use or commission—it was born purely out of curiosity and a desire to explore the end-to-end product development cycle in hardware. The design includes all core components of a mechanical numpad, including a custom PCB layout created in KiCad, Cherry MX-style switch support, and additional interface elements like a rotary encoder (knob) and a linear potentiometer slider for extended functionality.

The physical enclosure and keycap housing were modeled in Fusion 360, with attention to tolerances, ergonomics, and aesthetics. I explored multiple design iterations to ensure proper component fit, easy assembly, and a clean, modern look. Though the project never moved beyond the prototype stage, it gave me hands-on experience in circuit design, 3D modeling for manufacturing, and the nuances of designing for both electrical and mechanical constraints.

This project was a sandbox for learning and experimentation—especially in integrating electronics and physical design. It reflects my enthusiasm for making things from scratch, bridging mechanical engineering with embedded hardware, and constantly pushing myself to build better.
