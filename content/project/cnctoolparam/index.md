title: CNC Tool Parameter Calculator
summary: Developed a Progressive Web App (PWA) for calculating CNC tool parameters including cutting forces, power, surface finish, and tool life. Built with Flask and Firebase, the tool features an intuitive UI for entering machine, tool, and material data. Supports tool-specific presets (drill, endmill, face mill, etc.) and includes multi-level user modes—Beginner to Expert—with smart profile suggestions and tooltip guidance. PDF export and offline support enable real-world shop floor usage. Designed to assist machinists, engineers, and students with better tool selection and machining decisions, reducing guesswork and improving process efficiency.
