As a self-driven web development project, I built a CNC Tool Parameter Calculator designed to help machinists and engineers estimate key machining metrics like cutting force, power consumption, tool life, and surface finish.

The backend was developed in Python using Flask, with a responsive frontend built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and enhanced with Progressive Web App (PWA) features to support offline usage and mobile access. Core calculation logic was implemented in Python, handling inputs such as spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and material properties to generate precise output values.

The interface includes tool and material presets, user-selectable experience modes (Beginner to Expert), and helpful tooltips to guide parameter input. Users can also export calculation results as PDF reports for documentation or shop floor reference.

Though the app remains in an early prototype stage, it reflects my passion for combining mechanical engineering with full-stack development, while solving real-world problems with clean, data-driven tools.
