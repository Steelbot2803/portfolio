As part of a three-member Bachelor’s capstone project, I co-developed a low-cost, portable oxygen concentrator intended for emergency use in rural or resource-constrained healthcare settings—without relying on bulky oxygen cylinders or power-hungry compressors.

The system generated oxygen through the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, with the output filtered and collected in a flexible storage chamber. A custom-built sinusoidal pumping mechanism was designed to deliver oxygen in rhythm with human breathing cycles for comfort and efficiency.

My role focused on designing the Arduino-controlled delivery system, managing valve actuation and pump timing. To address the thermal risks associated with peroxide decomposition, I also conducted thermal and structural analysis in ANSYS and Fusion 360, ensuring the enclosure could handle heat buildup safely.

While the concept showed promise, the project remained at an early prototype stage due to several fundamental limitations—primarily related to chemical handling, safety concerns, and sustained oxygen yield. Despite this, the experience provided valuable insight into medical device prototyping, embedded system integration, and the challenges of working at the intersection of chemistry and mechanical design.
