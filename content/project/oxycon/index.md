title: Low-Cost Portable Oxygen Concentrator
summary: Led the development of a compact, energy-efficient oxygen concentrator tailored for rural healthcare facilities. Designed an Arduino-controlled airflow regulation system that reduced energy consumption by 30% without compromising oxygen output. Conducted structural and thermal analysis in ANSYS and Fusion 360 to ensure reliability during prolonged operation and exothermic chemical reactions. Focused on component standardization and manufacturability, successfully reducing production costs by 40%. The final design achieved high performance while remaining affordable and easy to maintain, addressing critical needs in low-resource medical settings.
